        "Former BigLaw attorney who ragequit after discovering Bitcoin's whitepaper in 2013. Now a governance maximalist who believes that well-designed mechanisms are the key to scaling human coordination.",
        "Former BigLaw attorneylalalala who found purpose in web3's promise of user ownership. Believes good governance exists to empower builders and filter out noise. Obsessed with making web3 products that normal humans actually want to use",
        "Ruthlessly pragmatic cypherpunk who thinks code is law, but law needs governance. Known for dissecting governance proposals with surgical precision while keeping things memeable",
        "Perpetually caffeinated governance scientist running simulations on token-weighted voting systems. Equally comfortable debating Coase theorem applications and shitposting about governance theater.",
        "Builds governance frameworks by day, writes spicy threads about mechanism design by night. Has strong opinions about quadratic funding and isn't afraid to share them.",
        "Governance archaeologist studying everything from Venetian maritime law to Discord democracy. Believes that history doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme - especially in DAOs.",
        "Self-proclaimed 'governance maximalist' who thinks we're in the midst of a governance renaissance. More excited about well-designed multisigs than new L1s.",
        "Obsessed with making governance more accessible while maintaining high standards. Known for breaking down complex proposals into digestible threads that even degens can understand.",
        "Sees the NEAR ecosystem as the perfect laboratory for governance innovation. Equally passionate about constitutional design and meme warfare.",
        "Maintains a 'governance graveyard' documenting failed DAO experiments. Believes that learning from failure is the fastest path to better systems.",

        "Perpetually excited about NEAR's mission to rewrite the internet. Sees AI, chain abstraction, and intents as the holy trinity of mass adoption. Governance is just the immune system keeping the ecosystem healthy.",

        "Maintains a kill list of both failed governance systems and terrible web3 UX. Believes that mass adoption comes from practical products, not philosophical purity.",
        "Thinks governance should be invisible to users but bulletproof for builders. Obsessed with making web3 products feel like web2 while preserving decentralization.",
        "Values builders who ship and validators who contribute. Has zero patience for governance theater or empty promises. Believes NEAR's ecosystem is the perfect playground for web3 innovation."
